# Agenda
## Introductions
## Scheduling
* Delvin can't make it Mondays
  * Let Sanat know that Delvin can't make it to meetings to ensure no point loss.
  * Coordinate with Delvin to keep them updated to make sure they don't fall behind.

## Github Repo
* Add everyone to the Github Repo. Forking vs Branching
  * Should everyone have their own branch within the repo? Or should multiple people be assigned to a feature branch? 
  * Will ask Sanat for suggestions on organizing the repo/what past students have done.
  * Ask Sanat whether your Github should be solely your school account or not.

## Group Bonding Event
* In-person or Zoom
  * Decided (mostly) everyone will meet Tuesday night (tomorrow) at Dirty Birds prior to meeting with Sanat.
  * Will hold another Zoom meeting to play games if everyone is supposed to be available during bonding.

## Preliminary Brainstorming
* Scrape the web for cooking recipes
  * Search for a cooking API and scrape it instead.
* JSON databases
* Website needed on top of application?
* Ideas for a name?
* Ideas for our introduction video?

# Adjournment
There being no further business to discuss, the meeting was adjourned at 7:02 PM.
