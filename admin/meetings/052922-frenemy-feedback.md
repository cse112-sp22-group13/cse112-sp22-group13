### End User Feedback/Thoughts

**Reviewer:** Mihir Gupta

* Many of the cards on the front page lead to empty pages
* Liked the different search categories
* Cuisines were alphabetically sorted -- assumed there were more, but took a while to find the horizontal scroll bar
  * Should make this a little more apparent to the user -- always visible?
* Expected ingredients categories to have specific ingredients rather than grocery store aisles, or for aisle cards to be categories for specific ingredients (e.g. herbs & spices => thyme)
* Not too sure what favoriting does -- would like more apparent change in UI/more clear favorites list
* Currently can't create/add recipes
* Shopping looked interesting, not sure what it did at a glance
* Could consider copying recipes to edit them vs. just making a note
* Should make sure app looks good on mobile/different dimensions as well
* Could generate "similarity score" for ordering search results
* Liked our current UI over original site's
* Recipe cards could have prep time, # of ingredients as well -- cuisines didn't seem super helpful (was viewing a specific cuisine)
* Could change "Recipes" header to the category name
* Could sort recipes by various parameters (# ingredients, prep time, etc.) within categories
* Could add filters on recipe list pages -- the other categories, # of servings, calories, etc.
* Could add servings, calories onto recipe pages themselves (pulled from Spoonacular)
* Somewhat confused with Full Stack vs. Knead it -- which was team name, what the other one was
* Prep time -- could sort into brackets up to a certain range (e.g. two "categories", so 2hrs contains recipes through 1hr and 45min)

### Peer Developer Feedback/Thoughts

**Reviewer:** Logan Ramos

* E2E/unit test distinction isn't very clear -- could separate them so it is easier to tell them apart
* File structure is pretty logical and organized
* Their team used 1 ticket per person system (our tickets are assigned to teams)
* Could use mock services for CRUD testing with APIs/endpoints (from Firebase, Jest-Puppeteer)
* Should clean up JS documentation -- take out stuff that isn't used anymore and add new JSDocs where relevant
* Could move adrs, md files, etc. to a `docs` folder, although `admin` seems to serve this purpose
* Feature-branch model makes sense
* Pipeline, agile workflow looks fine
* Structure-wise, everything looks good -- can tell that it has changed from the original 

**End Time:** 2:00 PM
