# 10-26-21 Meeting with Sanat, Andy, Scott and Alanna

# Call to Order
The first brainstorm meeting involving Team 4 members was called to order at 7:30 PM.

Add user stories for our target audience (initially had written user personas)

Wireframes – UI – Figma

Pitch – summarize what Sanat’s seen. (pitch to a possible customer/shareholder)
	Not completely stuck with the features we pitch but shouldn’t overpromise too much
  Shape Up Book: Chapter Write the Pitch pg. 57
  Get this done ASAP because once approved, can start coding/implementation. Don’t wait until deadline!
  Under promise and over deliver
  Shape up book
  Need user stories
  Act as if Sanat is a user and investor
  

Should start meeting twice a week once we start coding!

Need to finalize people's roles and subteams.

Play around with API's (Andy and Patrick).

Sanat will add in a new Slack bot for stand-ups.

Scott volunteers for pitch but if anyone wants to do it speak up!

# Adjournment
There being no further business to discuss, the meeting was adjourned at 8:30 PM.
