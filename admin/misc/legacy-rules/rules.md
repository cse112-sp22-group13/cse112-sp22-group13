## Team Procedures
1. Day, time, and place for regular **team meetings**:<br/>
Monday 6:30 PM - 7:30 PM PST<br/>
Meet on 1st floor of Geisel West<br/>
Any additional meetings may be scheduled either in-person or virtually 

1. Preferred method of **communication** in order to inform each other of team meetings, announcements, updates, reminders, issues, and project responsibilities: <br/>
We will be communicating through the group’s workspace on Slack. We will make use of the specific channels to keep different conversation types organized. If any virtual meetings are scheduled, it will occur through Zoom.

3. **Decision-making policy** (consensus or majority vote): <br/>
We will make decisions based on what the majority vote is. In the case of a tie, we will base the decision on a consensus.

4. Method for setting and following meeting **agendas**: <br/>
Team leaders will post the meeting agenda in the ‘agenda’ channel on Slack every Monday prior to the evening meeting. Team members can add to the agenda if needed. Whoever is taking the minutes for the meeting that day will use the agenda as a template. Team leaders will be responsible for the teams following the agenda.

5. Method of **record keeping**: <br/>
Meeting minutes will be assigned in a revolving cycle every week. Unless a secretary is assigned who will handle all meeting record keeping, it will be evenly divided among all team members. 
All commits to a branch, closing of issues, and PR’s should be with description in order to keep a stable record of all code changes. 
All project conversations, brainstorming, and decisions should be within Slack for the sake of careful record keeping. 

## Team Expectations

### Work Quality
1. **Project standards**: <br/>
The level of quality we expect from each member of the team is to provide substantial amounts of cooperation, drive, and creativity. Each member that is assigned a specific role to the project shall uphold that role and exhibit skills within that role. For example, designers must exemplify creativity and produce complex ideas, while researchers shall collect abundant information to support the design of the project. Front-end and back-end developers must pay full attention to detail while working on specific features, and have input to feature aspects without leading astray from the desired design. All roles shall communicate effectively amongst their sub-teams and the entire team so that everyone has the same expectations of the outcome of the project. Members should have their questions answered and clarified before continuing with their work. Lastly, every member shall exemplify their own type of leadership and take initiative when they notice things are heading in the wrong direction. It is up to the team as a whole, and the individual, to make sure that the project stays on track and covers all requirements of the assignment.

2. **Strategies** to fulfill these standards: <br/>
There will be frequent team and individual check-ups to ensure we are accurately meeting the project needs and expectations. Team leaders may contact any member periodically to confirm the member is completing the work within their role. Weekly stand-up meetings will also be scheduled once roles are assigned. During stand-ups, every member will share what items they have completed, tasks they are currently working on, and what areas they are stuck on. During Monday team meetings, it is expected that every member provides qualitative feedback and ideas toward the project. If a member falls behind or misses a meeting, they will be reminded to read the minutes and Slack channels in order to get caught up. Every member is subject to being reminded to contribute toward the project while they should also be reminding others to do the same.

### Personal Accountability
1. Expected individual attendance, punctuality, and participation at all team meetings: <br/>
We expect team members to show up on time since the meeting times have been set ahead of time and will be recurring weekly. All team members are expected to either attend a meeting for the entire duration, or to catch up by reviewing the minutes if they cannot attend/show up late/leave early. If there is something that needs to be done on their part, the minutes/Slack will let them know what needs to be done. Team members are expected to participate during the meeting by providing input/ideas, and agreeing/disagreeing on actions.

2. Expected level of responsibility for fulfilling team assignments, timelines, and deadlines: <br/>
All team members will take on equal responsibility for getting assignments turned in before the deadline. If a team member is worried about getting their part done prior to the deadline, they need to communicate with the members so that something can be done and the assignment can still be completed in time. 

3. Expected level of communication with other team members: <br/>
All team members must be active on Slack daily. Every main team channel must be read as pinned announcements may occur frequently. Additionally, members must be continuously active within their own sub-team channels and communicate effectively within those sub-teams (i.e. designers, researchers, specific feature developers) so that their teammates are all on the same page. Close and frequent communication with the Team Leaders is also expected so that members are comfortable with discussing any aspect of their work.

4.  Expected level of commitment to team decisions and tasks: <br/>
Since we are all sharing leadership responsibilities, we will equally commit to team decision making and task effort.

## Conflict Resolution
1. Handling infractions of any of the obligations of this team contract: <br/>
If a team member shows signs of infractions of their obligations, the group will remind the member of their duties. The Team Leaders will then begin issuing warnings if a member continues to forget about their obligations every week.

2. What the team will do if the infractions continue: <br/>
If the team recognizes that a team member is not following the rules of the contract for an extended period of time (such as missing most meetings without following up or not putting in the effort for their part(s) of the project), the team will provide a warning to the person. Following a warning, it will be expected that the member will no longer continue falling back on their duties. If the member does not change their behavior after notification, the team may contact the TA and decide how to proceed from there.
