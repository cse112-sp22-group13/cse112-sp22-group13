# Team Full Stack (Team 13)
<!-- ![team icon](/admin/branding/teamicon.png) -->

## Brand
Our brand theming is centered around bread, in honor of the group we inherited this project from. Our use of this baked pantry staple represents both our focus on refining the "bread-and-butter" of software engineering and our aim of having our end product be the "best thing since sliced bread".

## Team Values

From our experiences in previous project groups, we have decided on a pragmatic set of values: respecting the build pipeline (not attempting to shortcut/bypass it for the sake of velocity), code clarity/consistency among team members, high test coverage through unit/integration/E2E testing depending on which makes sense in the context of our app, accessibility through good code practices (semantic HTML) and providing multiple use options, and documentation of the codebase and throughout the repository.
