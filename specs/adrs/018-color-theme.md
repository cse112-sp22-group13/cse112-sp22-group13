# Color Theme

* Status: accepted <!-- optional -->
* Deciders: Anh, Kai, Lucius, Eric, TJ <!-- optional -->
* Date: 5-31-2022 <!-- optional -->

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to decide what color/theme to use for our website. Which aesthetic works best?

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* Recipe cards/icons will have many different colors
* We will only have one theme, so we want it to be fairly neutral/inoffensive

## Considered Options

* Realistic
* Orange/brown
* Green
* Monochrome (B&W)
* Red & Black

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Monochrome (B&W)", because it is the most inoffensive color palette and will provide good contrast with the recipe cards.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Inoffensive
* Does not clash with recipe cards

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Minor "corporate" vibe
