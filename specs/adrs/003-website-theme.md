## Context and Problem Statement

We want our recipe book to be appealing to users in terms of the UI and the types of recipes offered. 
For this reason, we want to redesign the interfaces and allow the recipe book to store more types of recipes than just bread.
With the additional goal of maintaining the original website's "feel" and overall themes, to what extent should we make these changes?

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* Current UI looks a little clunky/old-school
* Only allowing bread recipes feels restrictive for a recipe book -- limits actual potential userbase
  *  The number of times people bake bread is likely far lower than the number of times they cook in general

## Considered Options

* Stay with current design/recipe limitations
* Update design, keep recipe limitations
* Keep current design, remove recipe limitations
* Update design and remove recipe limitations

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Update design and remove recipe limitations", because we want to make our app more appealing for potential users; having a nicer looking display and removing the restriction on bread-only recipes makes the app more usable for a general audience.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Improves usability
* Improves "feel" of website
* Can shift bread theme from recipe list to UI to maintain the original theme in some way

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Potential concern with how much space the recipe book takes up -- potential to store more recipes without the restriction of bread
* More time investment to create new designs and implement them as well as editing recipe book

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Stay with current design/recipe limitations

* Good, because it is less work for us 
* Good, because it keeps original intent fully intact
* Bad, because it worsens user experience, makes our app less appealing to use

### Update design, keep recipe limitations

* Good, because it makes the app more visually appealing/easier to use
* Bad, because users are still limited to bread only, which reduces their opportunities to use the app
* Bad, because designing and implementing a new interface is more complex than removing the recipe type limitation

### Keep current design, remove recipe limitations

* Good, because we do not need to spend time on designing new UIs (design + implementation is likely more time-intensive than removing recipe limitation)
* Bad, because the current design feels somewhat dated/hard to use
* Bad, because users are likely to care a lot about UI

### Update design and remove recipe limitations

* Good, because it addresses issue of clunky UI
* Good, because it addresses issue of limited use cases with only bread recipes
* Bad, because it is harder to maintain original theme/intent of website with more substantial revisions to the base
* Bad, because it means we have more work to do
