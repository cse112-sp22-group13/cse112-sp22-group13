* Deciders: Jon, Nat, Yijie, Anh, Peder
* Date: 2022-05-09 

## Context and Problem Statement

To improve the site we have decided to evolve from using local storage to using cloud storage. In order to do this we have to make certain decisions: What cloud storage solution do we want to use? How do we want to interact with our storage?

## Considered Options

* Firebase: Cloud Firestore
* Node.js with other cloud service


## Decision Outcome

Chosen Firebase, because the team has more experience with this implementation. We also believe Firebase implementation is easy to learn and functionality like implementing "users" is fairly straightforward.
