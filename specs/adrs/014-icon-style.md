## Context and Problem Statement

We want to decide what our ingredient icons should look like. Which art style is the best for our project?

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* Want something with good contrast w.r.t. mostly black/white base site color theme


## Considered Options

* Silhouette on plate
* Outline
* Full color
* Any combination of the previous

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Silhouette on plate" with "Full color" (full-color icons on plate), because this provides high-constrast/visible icons while having a sense of personality/flair/uniformity with the plates. These two options also tied when we did a group vote.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Increased visibility => more accessible site
* Preserves sense of uniqueness/site identity
* Relatively uniform shape of plates make the icons look good

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* A little more work to merge the two styles than picking oan individual one

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Silhouette on plate

* Good, because plate adds some "charm"/uniqueness
* Bad, because not extremely visible/would rather have the main component (the ingredient) be filled as positive space rather than negative space

### Outline

* Good, because simple
* Bad, because not the best visibility
* Bad, because not as visually appealing as the other two

### Full color

* Good, because eye-catching
* Good, because visually pleasing
* Bad, because somewhat non-uniform shape-wise
