* Status: accepted <!-- optional -->
* Deciders: Eric, TJ, Anh, Kai, Jon, Xavier, Nat, Peder, Rodney, Lucius <!-- optional -->
* Date: 6-1-2022 <!-- optional -->

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to improve our app's clarity for the user so they know where they are on the app at all times. How can we clarify this information for a user?

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* Feedback from team 3 in frenemy feedback session, at [052922-frenemy-feedback.md](../../admin/meetings/052922-frenemy-feedback.md)
* Default "Recipes" header is not helpful (we know everything is a recipe)

## Considered Options

* No change
* Use search query/category name as header
* Add new display on screen with search query/category info

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Use search query/category name as header", because it clarifies to the user where they are without adding clutter.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Reduces potential clutter
* Mostly easy to implement
* Clear signposting

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Search queries might be a little harder to deal with/display well

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### No change

* Good, because easy for us to not do anything
* Bad, because reduces clarity and thus usability
* Bad, because users would want to know where they are/what recipes they are viewing

### Use search query/category name as header

* Good, because search query/name are helpful descriptors (as they are specified by the user)
* Good, because they provide info about where the user is without adding clutter

### Add new display 

* Good, because it would addres our concern
* Bad, because increases clutter
