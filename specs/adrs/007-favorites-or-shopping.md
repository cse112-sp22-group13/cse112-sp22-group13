* Status: accepted <!-- optional -->
* Deciders: Eric, Rodney, Xavier, TJ, Anh, Peder, Jon, Nat, Lucius <!-- optional -->
* Date: 5-19-2022 <!-- optional -->

## Context and Problem Statement

With limited time left in the quarter, we want to consider what features we should prioritize. Should we focus on the favorites function first, or should we take a look at the shopping integration?

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* Not a lot of time left
* Aim for this course is to get to a 1.0 product

## Considered Options

* Prioritize favorites list
* Prioritize shopping functionality

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Prioritize favorites list", because it is simpler and it is a feature most users would expect on a recipe manager.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* More sensible to have user accounts on the backend
* Less work overall

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Some wasted work with the shopping cart modal if we do not get to it
* Less "exciting"

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Prioritize favorites list

* Good, because likely simpler/will take less time and is less risky
* Good, because it makes sense with user accounts to have favoriting functionality
* Bad, because we waste some work in designing/implementing the shopping cart modal

### Prioritize shopping functionality

* Good, because we already have designs/website skeletons in React
* Good, because it is more interesting and is likely a feature users would find useful
* Bad, because we have not really looked into the Instacart integration and that may take a long time
