# Recipe Categories

* Status: accepted <!-- optional -->
* Deciders: Anh, Kai, Lucius <!-- optional -->
* Date: 5-23-2022 <!-- optional -->

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to decide on how to present/organize recipes. Which categories should we use on our front page?

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* Want to facilitate user workflow/categories users would most likely use
* Don't want too many categories because it would become cluttered

## Considered Options

* Cuisines
* First letter
* Ingredients
* Calories
* Prep time

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Cuisines", "Ingredients", and "Prep time", because they are useful in different ways and would be filters a user would expect

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Three options is enough where the user has options but does not feel overwhelmed
* Chosen options are expected features/likely the most popular categorization 

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Some of these (ingredients, prep time) will take a little more work on the backend
