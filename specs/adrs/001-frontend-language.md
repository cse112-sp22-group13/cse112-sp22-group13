# Frontend Language

* Status: Superceded by [006-frontend-language-2.md](006-frontend-language-2.md) <!-- optional -->
* Deciders: Eric, Kai, Lucius, Nat, TJ, Xavier, Anh, Jon, Peder, Rodney <!-- optional -->
* Date: 2022-04-25 <!-- optional -->

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to consider which language to use for the frontend of our app. Should we stay with vanilla JavaScript or switch to React?

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* React is relevant/trendy in the tech industry -- good to have experience with it
* Some people on our team have experience with React, so it will be easier to onboard than all of us learning from scratch
* Useful for frontend libraries/components

## Considered Options

* Switch to React
* Stay with vanilla JavaScript

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Switch to React", because it would be good to have some experience with React, it may improve productivity on future frontend additions/changes, and team members are familiar with it.
For this migration to be realistic/have minimal risk, we will aim to have the current codebase migrated by the end of week 6 and re-evaluate where we we are at that point.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* May improve frontend productivity in the future
* React is useful so it is good to build experience with it

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Regardless of who has experience with it, still some onboarding time with people learning new technology
* Time spent moving the codebase to React is time where not much progress is being made
  * We will only reap the benefits once people are familiar with React and we are implementing new things

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Switch to React

* Good, because React is a useful tool to build experience with
* Good, because we have members who have used React in the past
* Bad, because of onboarding time for members without React experience

### Stay with vanilla JavaScript

* Good, because it is less work for us to keep using JavaScript
* Good, because all of us have JavaScript experience
* Bad, because members are interested in gaining experience with React
